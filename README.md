# hackthevalley8
My project for Hack The Valley 8.

Identifies the colour the cursor is pointed at when the configured key is pressed.
Config in text file for non-programmers, can choose to use detailed or basic colour definitions as well as changing the activation key.
By default, detailed colours are used as well as left alt for activation since it is less likely to interfere by typing.

Works Python 3.9.10, Pillow 10.0.0, pyautogui 0.9.53 and PyScreeze 0.1.28 and keyboard library of any version (may not work with other versions of these libraries).
For more info on non-alphanumeric keys or modifiers: https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard#keyboard.all_modifiers

Took colour definitions from: https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html (added orange to basic because it belongs there)

I also cleaned up and formatted the copy/paste data using Sheets and Notepad++ operations.
